# CITS5505 Group Project â€“ Group 15

## Project Description

This application is developed to address key inefficiencies and limitations in how NDIS providers currently collect and manage client data. Traditionally, patient records and progress reports are exchanged through emails and scattered documents, resulting in delayed communication, data inconsistency, and difficulty in tailoring effective support plans.

Our platform provides a centralized, role-based data management system that enables Support Workers (SWs) to submit structured and therapist-specific reports. Each report is designed to be simple, multi-dimensional, and compliant with standard data formats. The submitted data is automatically routed to the relevant Therapists (e.g., Occupational, Physical, or Psychological), ensuring data privacy and relevance.
