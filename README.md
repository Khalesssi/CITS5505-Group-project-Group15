## 1.Project Description and Key Features

This application is developed to address key inefficiencies and limitations in how NDIS providers currently collect and manage client data. Traditionally, patient records and progress reports are exchanged through emails and scattered documents, resulting in delayed communication, data inconsistency, and difficulty in tailoring effective support plans.

Our platform provides a centralized, role-based data management system that enables Support Workers (SWs) to submit structured and therapist-specific reports. Each report is designed to be simple, multi-dimensional, and compliant with standard data formats. The submitted data is automatically routed to the relevant Therapists (e.g., Occupational, Physical, or Psychological), ensuring data privacy and relevance.

---

This platform offers a rich set of features tailored to various user roles in the **NDIS ecosystem**, including **Support Workers**, **Therapists**, **Guardians**, and **Administrators**, ensuring seamless collaboration and accurate, role-specific data handling.

### Web Features & User Interface

- **Role-Based Dashboards**  
  Upon login, users are redirected to personalized dashboards based on their roles (Support Worker, Therapist, Guardian, or Admin), each providing targeted tools and data.

- **Interactive Home Page**  
  A public homepage introduces the platform‚Äôs purpose and allows users to browse before login. Navigation options include returning to the dashboard or logging out.

- **Chatbot Guide**  
  An integrated chatbot assistant helps new users understand how to use the platform, guiding them step-by-step.

---

### Authentication & User Flow

- **Secure Login & Registration**  
  Users register with their email and select a role (validated on the server). Email format and role input are checked on both the frontend and backend.

- **Session Control**  
  Logged-in users can:
  - Log out securely
  - Browse the public site
  - Return to their private dashboard without re-authentication

## 3. How to Run

### üì¶ 1. Set Up the Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```ini
SECRET_KEY= yourSecretKey
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/app.db
FLASK_ENV=development
```

> üßæ If you downloaded the **project zip file**, this `.env` file is already included and configured. You may skip this step.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è 3. Set Up the Database

Apply database migrations:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

---

### üß™ 4. Insert Dummy Data (Prototype Login Setup)

This system is a **prototype**, so user accounts and data must be pre-inserted into the database for testing. Patients and relationships are not created dynamically in this version.

Run the following data insertion scripts **in order**:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.insert_UserPatient
python3 -m scripts.insert_sp
python3 -m scripts.insert_questionnaire_answers
```

> These scripts will insert demo users, support plans, and questionnaire data for testing role-based functionality.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- All tests use `TestingConfig` with an in-memory SQLite database.
- You can run each test file individually to isolate failures.
- Ensure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed before running tests.

---

### B.System Tests

These system tests simulate real user interactions using Selenium WebDriver, and automatically launch a live version of the Flask server (as required by the rubric). Each test runs independently and verifies critical user flows.

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to browser and port constraints, these system tests must be run individually using the provided commands above. Running them all at once with discover is not supported.
